            <div class="modal-text" id="ModalText2">We are experts at rapidly establishing trust with our clients and helping them establish trust with their peers. Our trainings, designed using the latest findings in neuroscience, are 90 minutes, short enough to be digestible for your staff and integrate into their workday and be immediately applicable to their daily job. Our process is simple, the first 15 minutes we set the frame for the new knowledge. The next 45 minutes we teach one concrete tool and practice using that tool to make the knowledge immediately impactful. The final 30 minutes is devoted to the group identifying the challenges inherent in their system and using the tool to collaboratively design solutions to preempt them.

With this high-impact approach, we observe leaders and their teams interacting in their regularly scheduled weekly business meetings, we give real-time feedback to the team and follow-up with 1:1 developmental coaching sessions with the leader. Through a 3 to 12 month engagement that includes targeted leader coaching, as well as spot coaching for team members, plus the design and facilitation of quarterly off-sites, expect dramatic—even exponential—improvement in the effectiveness and satisfaction of leaders, their teams, and the whole organization.</div>
